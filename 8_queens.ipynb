    "#### Positions. \n",
    "The positions list shows the location of each queen in a 2-Dimensional space.  It is a list of 2-tuples, $n$ long, where $n$ is the number of queens on the board.  Each tuple represents a coordinate pair $(x, y)$ for the location of a queen. For an  8-queen problem, the positions list would be represented as follows:\n",

    "#### Board.\n",
    "The board is a 2-dimensional numpy array that is built from the position list.  This board is a boolean encoding of where all the queens are on the board, with a `1` representing a queen, and `0` an empty cell.  This is purely to make the implementation of the evaluation easier.  By taking the sum of every row, column, and diagonal, we can easily calculate the number of queens attacking each other.  A solved board would have a maximum of 1 for each row, column, and diagonal sum:\n",
